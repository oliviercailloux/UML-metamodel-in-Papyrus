= UML metamodel in Papyrus

Using Eclipse version of the UML metamodel, found in the `org.eclipse.uml2.uml.resources` Eclipse plug-in (source https://git.eclipse.org/c/uml2/org.eclipse.uml2.git/tree/plugins/org.eclipse.uml2.uml.resources/metamodels[here]).

Can be used to show the UML metamodel, for example, illustrate that a UML `Class` is a `BehavioredClassifier`, itself a `Classifier`; that a `UseCase` also is a `BehavioredClassifier`, â€¦

== Quick start
Import this project into an Eclipse version containing Papyrus. Open the `Model Explorer` view, and from the `Project Explorer` view, open the `UML metamodel in Papyrus.di` file to let Papyrus display the content of your model in the `Model Explorer` view. Using the `Model Explorer` view, you can now create diagrams, and move elements from the `UML` metamodel into your diagrams.

Read these https://github.com/oliviercailloux/UML/blob/master/Papyrus/README.adoc[tutorials] to get started with Papyrus.

== Create from scratch
To create this project from scratch, do the following.

* Create a new project
* Copy the `UML.metamodel.uml` file inside that project (source link here above, or https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/guide/tools/import_wizards/import_wizards.htm[import] the `org.eclipse.uml2.uml.resources` plug-in into your Eclipse workspace)
* Create a new Papyrus model
* In the `Model Explorer` view, right-click your root model element, `Import` / `Import Package From User Model`, select the `UML.metamodel.uml` file, choose `Import`
